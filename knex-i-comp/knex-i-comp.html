    <p>
      Notes on the construction and operation of a working model of the
      Digi-Comp I imlemented in knex (tm).
    </p>

    <p>
      The original DigiComp I had three bits of state and three
      control stages.  It was effectively a mechanical programmable
      logic array (PLA).  This model in 
      <a href="../knex.html">knex (tm)</a>
      can be constructed to provide more or fewer bits and more or
      fewer control stages.

    <p>
      The original Digi-Comp I had three bits of state, each of which
      was implemented by a red plastic slider with a detent bump
      underneath so that the slider was forced into one state or the
      other and could not rest in between.
    </p>

    <p>
      The original Digi-Comp I had three control stages.  Each control
      stage could be "programmed" to set or clear certain bits
      depending on the states of the bits.  Each control stage had two
      actuator rods, one for setting bits and one for clearing them.
      Each control stage also had one sense rod for each actuator rod.
    </p>

    <p>
      The original Digi-Comp I had two sets of swinging metal rods,
      formed in such a way that the center of rotation was displaced
      from the center of the rod.
    </p>

    <p>
      On the front of the machine were the sense rods which sensed
      what state the bits were in.  On the back were the actuator rods
      which altered the states of the bits.  Each sense rod was
      coupled to its corresponding actuator rod at the top of the
      machine by a loose linkage which would allow the sense rod to
      push the actuator rod from its off-normal state but would
      otherwise allow the actuator rod to swing freely.  At the bottom
      of the assembly was a "clock" which consisted of two complex
      counter-moving linear cams which served to move the "clock rods"
      in and out to engage an disengage with any clock tubes which
      were mounted on the bit assemblies and which would drive any
      "logic rods" which were displaced from their rest state by their
      associated clock rod.
    </p>

    <p>
      The original Digi-Comp I was programmed by mounting small
      plastic tubes onto tabs that were present on the bit sliders.
    </p>

    <p>
      For our model, each bit assembly will have attatched to the gray
      strut on the actuator side, two connectors (typically red, the
      connector must have arity of at least 3 so that it can
      accomodate a strut perpendicular but off center to the gray
      strut to which the connector is attatched).  Each of these
      connectors corresponds to one actuator rod.  If a yellow strut
      is mounted in the connector then the actuator rod will engage it
      when it swings, altering the state of the bit.
    </p>

    <p>
      Mounted to the other gray strut (on the sense rod side) of the
      bit assembly are two subassemblies for each sense rod. These
      subassemblies are composed of two red (arity 3) connectors
      coupled by a green strut, so as to form the two adjacent corners
      of a half square.  One of the red connectors is mounted to the
      gray rod of the bit assembly. The other is alowed to twist on
      its green struts that its corresponding sense rod can pass free
      of it when the red connector is twisted vertically and is
      blocked by the red connector when it is twisted horizontally.
    </p>

    <p>
      When a sense rod is blocked by a horizontally twisted red
      connector, it is prevented from pushing its corresponding
      actuator rod from its off-normal position.  Otherwise, the
      actuator rod is moved off-normal and is captured and moved by
      the linear cam of the clock.  If it encounters a tube mounted on
      a bit, its motion will alter the state of the bit.
