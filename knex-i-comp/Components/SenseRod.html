      Sense Rod
    </h1>

    <p>
      The sense rods are analogous to the <i>clock rod</i>s of the
      Digi-Comp I.  It is the sense rods which examine the states of
      the bits and determine which
      <a href="ActuatorRod.html"><i>actuator rod</i></a>s 
      will operate during a given cycle.
    </p>

	  <p>
	    The picture shows a sense rod for a three bit knex-i-comp.
	  </p>

	  <p>
	    The white (arity 8) connector and yellow strut at the top
	    form the <i>sense rod weight</i> which ensures that the
	    sense rod will drop when allowed to.
	  </p>

	  <p>
	    The three yellow struts, red (arity 3) connector and gray
	    (arity 1) connector form the <i>control/actuator linkage
	    </i>, which engages with hardware at the top of the
	    corresponding
	    <a href="ActuatorRod.html"><i>actuator rod</i></a>
	    to move the actuator rod off-normal when the sense rod 
	    lowers.  In the picture, the fork of this linkage is 
	    shown rotated slightly so the full fork can be seen.
	    Normally, the fork would be rotated so aas to be flat
	    when the sense rod is mounted on the framework.
	  </p>

	  <p>
	    The sense rod moves up and down via a double hinged
	    swinging arm composed of two orange (arity 2) connectors.
	    One end of the arm is hinged through the center hole of
	    one of the orange (arity 1) connectors of the sense rod
	    proper.  The other end is hinged by a white strut to a
	    gray (arity 1) connector which is mounted vertically on
	    the structural framework.
	  </p>

	  <p>
	    There are one orange (arity 2) connector and one blue
	    strut per bit assembly.  The blue strut will engage with
	    the red (arity) 3 connectors of the
	    <a href="ProgrammingHardware.html"><i>programming hardware</i></a>
	    when the sense rod lowsers and the red connector is
	    oriented horizontally.
	  </p>

	  <p>
	    The horizontal blue strut mounted at the bottom engages
	    with the <i>sense rod lifter</i> during phases
	    <a href="Phases.html#phase3">3</a>,
	    <a href="Phases.html#phase4">4</a>,
	    <a href="Phases.html#phase5">5</a> and
	    <a href="Phases.html#phase6">6</a>
	    of the operating cycle.
