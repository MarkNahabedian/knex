      Control Frame Back Detail
    </h1>

    <p>
      This is an elevation detail of the back side of the control
      frame, shown from the inside of the structure.
    <p>

    <p>
      NOTE: that unlike the Digi-Comp I, the sense components are
      mounted on the back of the knex-i-comp rather than on the front
      like the Digi-Comp I.
    </p>

    <p>
      Next to each blue/purple composite connector are shown the
      connectors which are put together to form it, in their
      approximate orientations in the structure.
    </p>

    <p>
      The red (arity 3) connectors coupled by the white struts serve
      to keep the upper horizontal struts from rotating.  This is
      necessary since the bottom end of the <i>sense rod</i>s will be
      mounted here and will apply a torque to these struts.
