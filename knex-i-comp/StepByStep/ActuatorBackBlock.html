      Actuator Back-Block
    </h1>

    <p>
      The actuator back-block holds the actuator rods in their
      off-normal positions during phases 
      <a href="../Phases.html#phase2">2</a>, 
      <a href="../Phases.html#phase3">3</a>, 
      and 
      <a href="../Phases.html#phase4">4</a>, 
      of the operating cycle.
    </p>

    <p>
      The actuator back block is composed of one gray strut per
      control frame.  Between control frames, the structs are
      connected by orange (arity 2) connectors, which are mounted to
      the control frame by pairs of gray (arity 1) connectors coupled
      by green struts.
    </p>

    <p>
      In the picture below, the actuator back block is shown mounted
      on the
      <a href="ControlFrame.html"><i>control frame</i></a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      The right hand end of the actuator back block attatches to the 
      <a href="BackBlockLifter.html"><i>back block lifter</i></a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      At its left hand end, and at any intermediate points between
      control stages, the back block is mounted via the two gray
      (arity 1) connectors coupled by a green strut.
