      Back-Block Lifter

    <p>
      The actuator back-block lifter is at the right hand end of the 
      <a href="ActuatorBackBlock.html"><i>actuator back-block</i></a>.

    <p>
      The next picture shows how the back block lifter is mounted onto
      the right hand end of the control frame.  The three yellow
      struts and the blue/purple connector they are attatched to are
      from the bottom right of the control frame.

      In the next picture, the back block lifter is installed on the
      control frame and connected to the rest of the back block (gray
      strut coming in from the left).

    <p>
      NOTE the light blue spacer on the yellow strut of the control
      frame between the front yellow connector of the back block
      lifter and the blue/purple connector.  This spacer is necessary
      so that the
      <a href="ActuatorBackBlock.html"><i>actuator back block</i></a>
      doesn't bump against any 
      <i>actuator rod</i>s
      in their normal positions when the back block is lifted.
