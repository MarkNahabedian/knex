      Actuator Rod
    </h1>

    <p>
      The actuator rods are what change the states of the bits.
      They are analogous to the <i>logic rods</i> of the Digi-Comp I.
      There are two actuator rods per control stage.
    </p>

    <p>
      The actuator rods shown are for a single bit knex-i-comp.
      Additional segments are inserted in the middle for each
      additional bit.
    </p>

    <p>
      The picture shows two actuator rods as they would be attatched
      to the bit frame and bit frame top.  The blue strut, blue
      connectors and white struts which serve as hinge pins are parts
      of the bit frame and bit frame top.
    </p>

    <p>
      The red (arity 3) connectors and white struts provide
      sufficient stiffness so that the actuator rod doesn't flex
      during operation.
    </p>

    <p>
      The gray (arity one) connectors on the left combine with
      white struts vertically mounted on the 
      <a href="BitFrame.html"><i>bit frame</i></a>
      to form hinges on which the actuator rod can swing.
    </p>

    <p>
      The blue struts, in addition to providing structure, will
      engage with yellow struts mounted on the 

      <a href="ProgrammingHardware.html"><i>programming hardware</i></a>

      to alter the state of a 

      <a href="BitAssembly.html"><i>bit assembly</i></a>

      during

      <a href="../Phases.html#phase4">phase 4</a>

      of operation.
    </p>

    <p>
      The light gray (arity 2) connector near the bottom of the
      assembly engages with the <i>actuator driver</i> during 

      <a href="../Phases.html#phase4">phase 4</a> of operation.
    </p>

    <p>
      The yellow strut at the bottom engages against the
      <i>actuator back-block</i> to hold the actuator rod
      off-normal during phases

      <a href="../Phases.html#phase2">2</a> and 
      <a href="../Phases.html#phase3">3</a>

      of the operation cycle.
