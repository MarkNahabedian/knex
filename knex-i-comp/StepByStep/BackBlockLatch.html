      Back-Block Latch
    </h1>

    <p>
      The actuator back-block latch engages with the 

      <a href="BackBlockLifter.html"><i>back-block lifter</i></a>
      to hold the 

      <a href="ActuatorBackBlock.html"><i>actuator back-block</i></a>

      in its raised position.
    </p>

    <p>
      The back-block latch is installed at the right hand end of the

      <a href="ControlFrameBack.html"><i>control frame</i></a>.

      There is one back-block latch per knex-i-comp.
    </p>

    <p>
      The first picture shows a partially assembled back-block latch.

    <p>
      Below we see the back-block latch installed on the 

      <a href="ControlFrameBack.html"><i>control frame</i></a>.

      Note how the orange clip at the end of the red strut of the
      latch engages with the green strut on the yellow (arity 5)
      connector of the

      <a href="BackBlockLifter.html"><i>back-block lifter</i></a>.

      Slide the red strut in the white (arity 8) connector of the
      latch to adjust it so that it engages properly with the lifter.
      The pink clip under the white coinnector is to provide
      additional friction so that the red strut won't slide in the
      white connector during operation.
