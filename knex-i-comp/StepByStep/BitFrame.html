      Bit Frame
    </h1>

    <p>
      The bit frame is the structure on which all of the logic
      elements are mounted. There is one bit frame for each control
      stage (connected horizontally) and one for each bit (connected
      vertically), so the number of bit frames is the product of the
      number of bits and the number of control segments.
    </p>

    <p>
      Bit frames comprise a substantial portion of the structure of
      the knex-i-comp.
    </p>

    <p>
      Next to each blue/purple composite connector are shown the
      connectors which are put together to form it, in their
      approximate orientations in the structure.
    </p>

    <p>
      Only one bit frame in a given control stage needs to have the
      two orange clips.  These merely serve to prevent the actuator
      reods from unhinging when the knex-i-comp is tilted or inverted.
    </p>

    <p>
      The bit frame will also have a ywllow strut at each end,
      connecting the top and bottom corners together.  These struts
      are not shown here since it is easier to assemble the bit
      assembly directly onto these struts before they are in place.
    </p>

    <p>
      The bottom-most bit frame, which mounts on top of the control
      frame, does not have the blue strut which sticks out in the
      bottom of the picture.
    </p>

    <p>
      The two front corners (lower edge of the picture) of the
      bottom-most bit frame consist entirely of blue connectorsather
      than blue/purple pairs.  These provide attatchment points for
      the front upper level of the control frame.
    </p>

    <p>
      The upright blue struts will connect up to the next level. 
    </p>

    <p>
      For multiple control stages, the bit frames connect end-to-end
      with each bit frame sharing the blue and purple connectors at
      their corners with their neighbors.
    </p>

    <p>
      The upright white struts will serve as the hinge pins on which
      the <i>actuator rod</i>s swing.
