    <h1>Programming Hardware</h1>

    <p>
      The programming hardware is mounted on the bit assembly.  Each
      <i>bit assembly</i> has one set of programming hardware for each
      control stage.
    </p>

    <p>
      The red (arity 3) connectors are used to program the behavior of
      the <i>sense rod</i>s.  When a red connector is twisted
      horizontally, like the one on the left in the image above, the
      corresponding sense rod will be blocked by it if the bit is in
      the appropriate state.  Otherwise the sense rod is free to move
      and push its <i>actuator rod</i> off-normal.
    </p>

    <p>
      A yellow strut is mounted on the orange (arity 5) connector if
      this bit is to be changed by the set or reset <i>actuator
      rod</i> of this control stage.
    </p>


	Attatched to the bit assembly, the thing that
	the yellow struts that the actuator rods engage with mount on.
	each bit assembly, there is one of these for each actuator
	rod.
	The thing that the sense rods engage with, composed of two red connectors 
	and a green strut.
	There are two of these on each bit assembly for each sense rod.
