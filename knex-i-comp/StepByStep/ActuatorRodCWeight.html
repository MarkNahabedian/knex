      Actuator Rod Counterweight
    </h1>

    <p>
      There is one <i>actuator rod counterweight</i> for each

      <a href="ActuatorRod.html"><i>actuator rod</i></a>.  

      The actuator rod counterweight assembly includes the
      counterweight itself, and the mounting for the counterweight.
      The mounting for the counterweight also serves to keep the
      horizontal struts of the framework on which the upper ends of
      the

      <a href="SenseRod.html"><i>sense rod</i></a>s 

	are mounted from rotating in-place.
    </p>

    <p>
      The counterweight serves to restore the 

      <a href="ActuatorRod.html"><i>actuator rod</i></a>

      to its normal position.
    </p>

    <p>
      A piece of monofiliment line (represented in the picture by a
      piece of yellow cord so it would show up better) serves as a
      tendon connecting the counterweight to its corresponding

      <a href="ActuatorRod.html"><i>actuator rod</i></a>.

      A bowline is tied at one end and looped around the white strut
      at the top of the corresponding

      <a href="ActuatorRod.html"><i>actuator rod</i></a>

      just below the gray pulley.  The tendon is then threaded through
      the hub hole of the upright gray (arity 1) connector and then
      through the odd shaped hole in the middle of the upper gray
      (arity 1) connector through which the gray rod slides.  The end
      is then threaded through a hole in the white (arity 8)
      connector, wrapped through two adjacent clip locations and then
      clamped in place between the white (arity 8) connector and the
      green strut.  The length of the tendon is adjusted so that the
      tendon is pulled taught when the white (arity 8) connector of
      the counterweight rests on the bottom gray (arity 1) connector
      and the

      <a href="ActuatorRod.html"><i>actuator rod</i></a>

      is swung up against the structural framework.

      I used 10 pound test fishing line.  The monofilamet was chosen
      because it slips through its path with lower friction than
      multi-ply cord does.
