      Control Frame
    </h1>

    <p>
      The control frame is where most of the hardware which controls
      the sequence of operations is mounted.  It is the bottom-most
      section of the structure.  There is one control frame for each
      control segment of the device.

    <p>
      The picture shows the conrtol frame, viewed from above.

    <p>
      Next to each blue/purple composite connector are shown the
      connectors which are put together to form it, in their
      approximate orientations in the structure.
    </p>

    <p>
      The missing connectors are provided by the 
      <a href="BitFrame.html"><i>bit frame</i></a>
      which will be attatched immediately above the control frame.
    </p>

    <p>
      Each of the blue/purple connectors at the bottom level of the
      control frame stands on a white strut.  These white strut legs
      are not shown in the picture.
