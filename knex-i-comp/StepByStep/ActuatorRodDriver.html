      Actuator Rod Drivers

    <p>
      There are two actuator rod drivers per control stage (one for
      each

    </p>

    <p>
      The actuator rod drivers propel the off-normal
      <a href="ActuatorRod.html"><i>actuator rod</i></a>s,
      during 
      <a href="../Phases.html#phase4">phase 4</a>
      of operation.

      The picture shows one actuator rod assembly and the components
      of the linkage which connect the pair of actuator rods of a
      control stage together.  The linkage is composed of the white
      (arity 8) connector with the two blue struts attatched and two
      of the white struts with gray (arity 1) connector and pink clip.

      Pictured below are two actuator drivers installed on the control
      frame.  The red struts on which the actuator drivers are hinged
      mount on the control frame.  The pair of actuator rods are
      connected by the linkage which is suspended from the gray strut
      of the control frame so that it can slide from front to back,
      moving the actuator rod drivers as it does.
