      Bit Assembly
    </h1>

    <p>
      The bit assembly embodies the state of the knex-i-comp.  It's
      analogous to the <i>Digi-Comp I</i>'s <i>flip-flop</i>.  There
      is one bit asembly per bit frame.  
    </p>

    <p>
      In the knex (tm) model, each bit is implemented by an assembly
      of gray struts and yellow (arity 5) connectors.  The assembly is
      hung from an inverted pendulum formed from a pair of arms
      constructed from two gray (arity 1) connectors coupled together
      by a green strut. The inverted pendulum ensures that the bit
      assembly will rest in either of the two extreme positions of its
      motion and is not stable anywhere in between.  This provides
      hysteresis, which is necessary in all digital logic systems.
    </p>

    <p>
      The bit assemblies of a single bit connect end-to-end with one
      another, sharing the yellow connector inverted pendulum
      assemblies with their neightbors.

      the picture below it is fully assembled.

    <p>
      The yellow struts to which the inverted pendula (pendulums?)
      attatch are from the ends of the bit frame.

    <p>
      The yellow (arity 5) connectors which are parallel to the yellow
      mounting strut, in addition to holding gray struts of the bit
      assembly together, also serve to stop the inverted pendulum from
      swinging too far to either side.  That is why they are slid up
      against the inverted pendulum assembly instead of being anywhere
      along the bit assembly.
    </p>

    <p>
      The positioning of the programming hardware will need to be
      adjusted after the bit assembly is installed in the bit frame
      and the sense rods are in place.
