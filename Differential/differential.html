    <h1>K'NEX Differential</h1>

    <p>
      A differential is used in the rear axle of three and four wheel
      vehicles.  When such a vehicle turns, the wheel on the outside
      of the turn must follow a longer path than the wheel on the
      inside.  Since both wheels have the same circumference, the
      outside wheel must turn faster.  A differential is the mechanism
      used to achieve the difference in turning rate.

    <h2>internal gearing</h2>

    <p>
      There are four gears that are mounted inside the box framework
      of the differential.
    </p>

    <p>
      One medium sized red gear mounted to each axle.  These are the
      <i>side gears</i> of the differential.
    </p>

    <p>
      Two medium sized yellow spur gears are used as the <i>pinion
      gears</i> of the differential.  Their axis of rotation is
      perpendicular to that of the axles.  The pinion gears couple the
      motions of the two side gears (and the axles) to each other and
      to the motion of the framework.

    <h2>Attatching The Ring Gear</h2>

    <p>
      The ring gear is the part of the differential that is driven by
      a motor or whatever.  By driving the ring gear, the entire
      framework of the differential is rotated.

	    doesn't show the full framework, only the two connected
	    "square" subassemblies at one end of it.

	    The large yellow gear is mounted onto this white rod and
	    secured there with the tan clip.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    One axle of the differential will pass through the white
	    connector and the center hole of the yellow gear.  This
	    allows the driving of the yellow gear to rotate the entire
	    assembly while the axle is free to rotate independently of
	    the yellow gear.

    <h2>The Fully Assembled Differential</h2>

    <img

      alt="fully assembled differential"
      width="592"
      height="343">

    <p>
      If the differential were mounted on a chassis and driven by the
      large yellow gear, both red axles whould turn at the same rate
      so long as they both had the same resistance on them.
    </p>

    <p>
      Also observe that if the differential is held stationary and one
      red axle is rotated, the other rotates the same amount, but in
      the opposite direction.
    </p>

    <p>
      The angular velocity of the entire differential is equal to half
      the sum of the angular velocities of the two axles.
    </p>

    <p>
      K'nex doesn't come with large enough tires such that the wheels
      of a vehicle could be mounted directly to the axles of this
      differential.  K'nex also doesn't come with small enough spur
      gears (the yellow ones) or bevel gears, such that a smaller
      differential could be built.  To use this differential in a
      vehicle, some transmission mechanism (gears, drive chain or belt
      and pulley) would be needed to transfer motion from the axles
      of the differential to the wheels.
