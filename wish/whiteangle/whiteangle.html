    <h1>WhiteAngle K'NEX Part</h1>

    <p>
      I call this part the <i>whiteangle</i> because it's basically a
      white strut which instead of being straight, has a 90 degree
      angle in it.  If K'NEX were to manufacture this part, it would
      be desirable for there to be a hole (whose diameter is the same
      as those in the middle of a connector) at the angle so that
      struts can pass through.
    </p>

    <h2>What's it Good For?</h2>

    <p>
      The <i>whiteangle</i> can be used to keep two connectors which
      are joined by a green strut from rotating relative to one
      another on the axis of that strut.  This could also be achieved
      using a red connector and two white struts, but that arrangement
      is bulkier and requires more parts.
    </p>

    <h2>How to Make Them</h2>

    <p>
      It's not hard to make this part at home.  All one needs to do
      is make a miter cut in the middle of a white strut and then glue
      the two pieces together to form a right angle.
    </p>

    <table border="0" width="100%">
      <tr>
	<td>
	  <p>
	    An accurate miter cut can be made using a
	    <a href="http://www.dremel.com/">Dremel tool</a>
	    with drill press accessory and a jig made out of K'NEX.
	    With this jig one can cut two struts at a time, to
	    eventually make two <i>whiteangle</i>s.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    When mounting the two white struts in the jig, be sure
	    that they both have the same axial orientation.  This is
	    because once the miter cuts are made, the top piece from
	    one side of the jig will then be joined with the bottom
	    piece on the same side of the jig.  Since this piece is
	    from the other strut and it is desirable for the ridges
	    and grooves of the two pieces to line up with one another,
	    the axial orientation must match before the cuts are made.

      <tr>
	<td>
	  <p>
	    It's important that the height of the cutting head is
	    adjusted so that the cut is made right in the middle of
	    the mounted struts.  Line it up with the angle that is
	    formed between the two struts on either side.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    Because of the limited diameter of the cutter, cuts must
	    be made from both the front and back of the jig.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    The lowest speed setting was used to limit heat buildup
	    and melting of the plastic struts.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    If one were using a band saw instead of a Dremel tool,
	    one could lay the jig on its large end and make a cut
	    between the green connectors, at a 90 degree orientation
	    to the cut made here.

	    This picture shows one pair of cut parts being transferred

	    Both halves are now mounted in the gluing jig.  They should
	    be rotated axially in the jig so as to maximize the
	    contact surface.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    The glue can now be applied.  It may be appropriate to
	    partially disassemble the gluing jig so that the glue can
	    be applied to the contact surfaces.

	  <p>
	    I got good results using a gap filling cyanoacrylate (such
	    as Pacer "Zap-a-Gap").  I'd tried PC-7 epoxy (from
	    Protective Coating Company) but it did not adhere well to
	    the K'NEX plastic.
