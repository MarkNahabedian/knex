    <h1>About K'NEX</h1>

    <p>
      K'NEX is an extensible framework based construction system.
      Unlike Fischer Technik or Lego, which are based on interlocking
      blocks, K'NEX is more like Tinker Toys, consisting of struts and
      connectors which join together to form an open framework.

    </center>

    <p>
      Each connector has a number of clips which can attatch axially
      to the end of a strut or perpendicularly along its length.  We
      will refer to the number of clips as the <i>arity</i> of the
      connector.
    </p>

      <table border=1>
	<tr> <th>Color</th>	<th>Arity</th>	</tr>
	<tr> <td>dark gray</td>	<td align=center>1</td>	</tr>
	<tr> <td>light gray</td>	<td align=center>2</td>	</tr>
	<tr> <td>red</td>		<td align=center>3</td>	</tr>
	<tr> <td>green</td>	<td align=center>4</td>	</tr>
	<tr> <td>yellow</td>	<td align=center>5</td>	</tr>

	<tr> <td>blue</td>	<td align=center>7 <sup>*</sup></td> </tr>
      </table>
    </center>

    <p>
      Each connector has a "center" from which the clips extend.  The
      center has a hole which is the same diameter as that of a strut,
      so that a strut will fit in the hole and can rotate or slide
      within it.
    </p>

    <p>
      <sup>*</sup> The purple and blue connectors have a special slot in place
      of one of their clips.  These slots can fit together so that two
      connectors can be put together perpendicularly to one another.
    </p>

    <p>
      The struts vary in length.  If we consider not the length of a
      strut itself, but the distance between the centers of two
      connectors attatched at each end of a strut, then we see that
      each strut is longer than the next shorter strut by a factor of
      the square root of two.  We will refer to this measure as the
      <i>effective length</i> of a strut.  We can associate with each
      strut its number in the sequence of struts when ordered by
      increasing length.  We define the unit length as the distance
      between the centers of two connectors which are joined by a
      green strut, that is, the effective length of a green #1 strut.
    </p>

    <center>
      <table border=1>
	<tr> <th>Number</th>	<th>Color</th>	<th>Effective Length</th>	</tr>
	<tr>
	  <td align=center>#1</td>
	  <td align=center>green</td>
	  <td align=center>1</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	  <td align=center>#2</td>
	  <td align=center>white</td>
	  <td align=center>1 v2</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	  <td align=center>#3</td>
	  <td align=center>blue</td>
	  <td align=center>2</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	  <td align=center>#4</td>
	  <td align=center>yellow</td>
	  <td align=center>2 v2</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	  <td align=center>#5</td>
	  <td align=center>red</td>
	  <td align=center>4</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	  <td align=center>#6</td>
	  <td align=center>gray</td>
	  <td align=center>4 v2</td>
	</tr>
      </table>
    </center>

    <p>
      In the table above, we use "v2" to represent the square root of
      two, thus the notation "4 v2" represents four times the square
      root of two, approximately 5.66.  The reason for this particular
      progression in lengths will be apparent shortly.

    <p>
      The fundamental basis of all K'NEX is that of the right isosceles
      triangle.  This triangle has one ninty degree angle and two
      forty five degree angles.  It's two legs are the same length.
      It's hypotenuse is the square root of two (approximately 1.41)
      longer than the length of one leg, hence the peculiar square
      root of two factor in the lengths of the struts.

    <p>
      The above picture illustrates that the effective length of a
      given numbered strut is twice that of a strut whose number is
      two less.

    <p>
      If two connectors are clipped to opposite sides of a strut, the
      distance between their centers is that for a green connector
      divided by the square root of two.

    <p>
      This is consistent with the sum of the effective lengths of two
      such overlaps being equal to the effective length of a white
      strut.

    <p>
      The effective length of an overlap connection is equal to the
      distance between the centers of two clips on opposite sides of a
      connector.
