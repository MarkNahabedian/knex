    <h1>K'nex Measurement</h1>


    <p>
      We can consider the thickness of a blue spacer to be the
      fundamental unit of distance in the Knex system.  Note that in
      some cases this is just a good approximation since there are
      factors of the square root of two involved.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
	Each connector would be two such units thick.
      </li>
      <li>
	The distance from the centerline of the shaft bearing hole of
	a connector to the outside edge of the connector's clip is 6
	units.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Thus, the center to center distance for two connectors connected
      by a strut is as follows:
    </p>

    <table border="1">
      <tr>
	<th>strut</th>
	<th>center to center distance</th>
	<th>clip groove length</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
	<td>green</td>
	<td>12</td>
	<td>0</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
	<td>white</td>
	<td>17</td>
	<td>6</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
	<td>blue</td>
	<td>24</td>
	<td>12</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
	<td>yellow</td>
	<td>34</td>
	<td>22</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
	<td>red</td>
	<td>48</td>
	<td>36</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
	<td>gray</td>
	<td>68</td>
	<td>56</td>
      </tr>
    </table>
    
    <p>
      Gear and pulley dimensions (thickness and radius in spacer
      units):
    </p>

    <table border="1">
      <tr>
	<th>what</th>
	<th>tooth count</th>
	<th>thickness</th>
	<th>meshing radius</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
	<td>small gear (green, blue)</td>
	<td>14</td>
	<td>4</td>
	<td>3.5</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
	<td>medium gear (red)</td>
	<td>34</td>
	<td>4</td>
	<td>8.5</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
	<td>large gear (yellow)</td>
	<td>82</td>
	<td>3</td>
	<td>20.5</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
	<td>small pulley</td>
	<td>&nbsp;</td>
	<td>4</td>
	<td>&nbsp;</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
	<td>large pulley</td>
	<td>&nbsp;</td>
	<td>2</td>
	<td>&nbsp;</td>
      </tr>
    </table>

      How did I come up with these numbers?  Take a look at this
      picture.

      What can we see:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        The thickness of a connector is twice that of a blue spacer.
        This is shown more definitively in my page about
        <a href="Basic/shaft-lengths.html">
          shaft lengths
        </a>.
      </li>
      <li>
        The center to center distance of two connectors separated by a
        green strut is 10 blue spacers, plus two more to accout for
        the thickness of the shaft or connectors, for a total distance
        of 12 blue spacers.
      </li>
      <li>
        The <i>radius</i> of a connector, that is, the distance from
        its center to the edge of its clips, is half that, or 6 blue
        spacers.
      </li>
      <li>
        The center to center distance of two connectors separated by a
        white strut is 5 blue spacers longer than that of a green
        strut.
      </li>
    </ul>
