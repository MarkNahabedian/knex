    <h1>Drive Chain</h1>

    <p>
      The knex drive chain is composed of interlocking links which can
      be connected and disconnected from one another to make a drive
      chain of arbitrary length.  Each chain link can have a connector
      attatched to it.
    </p>

    <p>
      The picture below shows that nine links of chain are needed to
      span the length of a gray strut.

    <p>
      The picture below shows that to make a 180 degree loop around a
      drive chain wheel composed of two red gears, slightly less than
      four links are needed.
